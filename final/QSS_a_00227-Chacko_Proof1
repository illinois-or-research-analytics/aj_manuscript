However, IKC does not enforce global modularity maximization (Lancichinetti & Frtunato, 2011), which suffers from the theoretical problem of the resolution limit that favors larger clusters that can contains smaller clusters within (Fortunato & Barthelemy, 2007). Instead we require only that each cluster exhibit positive modularity, a mild constraint on cluster quality.

UNDER RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
FROM
As we explain in the preceding sections, AOC is a meta-method for overlapping communities that takes
as input a network $N$ and a clustering of the network produced by IKC, and has user-specified
parameters: (i) a set of candidate nodes for consideration of membership in multiple communities, and
(ii) a parameter $k$ or $m$ that defines the criterion for membership (Materials and Methods).
