\abstract{Community detection methods assist the understanding of complex networks through discovery of meso-scale structures. A variety of approaches have been developed for this purpose. However, many community finding methods rely on disjoint clustering techniques, in which a node is only assigned to one community or cluster. This strict requirement limits the ability to inclusively describe communities since some nodes may reasonably be assigned to many communities. Whereas we previously reported a scalable and modular pipeline that discovers disjoint research communities from the scientific literature, we now present a complementary overlapping community approach.  We present findings from this new approach on a network of over 13 million nodes that captures recent research in the very rapidly growing field of extracellular vesicles in biology.}

\section{Introduction} Research communities represent scientific specialization \citep{Chubin1976,Morris2009} that evolves in response to influences such as new research paradigms, policy effects, collaboration practices, increasing globalization, and large-scale reorganization. The problem of identifying and characterizing research communities in the modern scientific enterprise motivates the work presented in this article. We are interested in scalable methods for identifying research communities as they emerge and grow to maturity. We would also like to understand the extent to which these communities overlap. 
	
Beyond identifying communities, we are interested in their structure and roles played by community members. Of special interest is the core-periphery or center-periphery structure \citep{Breiger2014} since \cite{Price1966}, in their study of the oxidative phosphorylation community reported center-periphery structure: a small core of influential researchers and a much larger transient population. Core-periphery or center-periphery patterns have also been reported in other networks using different techniques, such as block modeling and k-core decomposition, arguing for some degree of ubiquity in their occurrence \citep{borgatti2000models,Rombach2017,gallagher2021clarified,yanchenko_2202.04455}. 
	
		
One approach to identifying research communities is through analyzing citation patterns in the scientific literature. The underlying assumption is that members of a research community are more likely to cite each other's work than the work from outside their community.  Drawing upon the rich literature on graph theory, this question can then be framed as a community finding problem where a community is defined as a set of vertices in a graph that exhibit stronger connectivity to each other than to vertices outside such a community. Thus, in the graph (or network) of scientific literature, citation-dense areas suggest the existence of communities of publications. This approach is different from characterizing the publications authored by members of known communities \citep{Price1966,crane1972invisible,smallspecialties1979,Mullins1985} since the community is first defined by edge-density and then 
its members are inferred from the authors of the community of publications \citep{Chandrasekharan2021,Wedell2022}.
	
We stress that citation density alone does not make a confirming argument for the existence of a community. However, community finding techniques are valuable in being able to search large datasets for communities, efficiently reducing them to smaller data that can then be examined with complementary techniques that include the use of domain expertise.
	
A considerable literature exists on community finding in graphs that reflects a diversity of perspectives and solutions. These diverse approaches can be drawn upon in identifying research communities \citep{Fortunato2009,FORTUNATO201075,Coscia2011,Yang2016}.  Community finding and clustering approaches have been applied to the scientific literature~\citep{Newman2006,Fortunato2009,Boyack2010,Boyack2019,Traag2019,Ahlgren2020,Chandrasekharan2021,Wedell2022}. The majority of these approaches focus on disjoint partitioning, where a vertex or node is only assigned to only one community.  This is a limitation when analyzing citation data, since some nodes can reasonably be assigned to more than one community; for example, publications introducing widely used methods may be integral to the research activities of multiple communities. 

Several methods have been developed that can produce overlapping clusters \citep{Baumes2005,Palla2005,banerjee2005model,Cleuziou2008,Lancichinetti2009,Lu2012}, although they do not appear to enjoy wide use in scientometric studies. 
	
We recently reported Iterative K-core Clustering or IKC \citep{Wedell2022}, a recursive algorithmic approach based on the k-core property \citep{Giatsidis2011,malliaros2019}, which helps identify densely connected parts of a graph. IKC recursively extracts disjoint k-cores from a graph beginning with the most dense  k-core and until some user-specified value of $k$ is reached. IKC avoids global modularity maximization \citep{lancichinetti2011limits} but enforces positive modularity for individual communities and the minimum value of $k$ set by a user. 
	
We implemented IKC as the first step in a tunable modular pipeline to identify communities with core-periphery structure. Subsequent steps in the pipeline include breaking large cores, and adding peripheral nodes to each core to construct communities with core-periphery structure. While IKC is a necessary step in the pipeline, the remaining steps are optional. We tested this pipeline against a network of greater than 14 million articles that are centered around the rapidly growing field of extracellular vesicle biology \citep{Wedell2022}. Using the IKC pipeline, we were able to identify two communities of interest, rich in extracellular vesicle literature, that were robust to various option settings \citep[Figures 5]{Wedell2022} from this large dataset.
	
However, IKC produces disjoint clusters, and some articles can reasonably be assigned to more than one community.  As noted above, this limitation impacts articles that describe widely used methods but is also relevant, in theory at least, to articles reporting discovery that are influential in more than one community.  Thus, a need for exists for methods that can produce meaningful overlapping clusters. 
	
Several methods have been developed that can produce overlapping clusters, although none of them were specifically designed to address core-periphery structure in the scientific literature  \citep{Baumes2005,Palla2005,banerjee2005model,Cleuziou2008,Lancichinetti2009,Lu2012}. An interesting approach is the two-step procedure where the input graph is first transformed into a line graph whose nodes represent edges in the original graph \citep{Harary1960}.  The line graph is then clustered and this output can be mapped back to the input graph to generate overlapping clusters. This general approach has been used by others on citation graphs \citep{Evans2009,Havemann2021}. 
	
However, line graph  techniques are not very scalable, since the size of a line graph is much larger than the size of its input graph. For example, the network that we studied in \cite{Wedell2022} would grow from 13,989,436 nodes and 92,051,051 edges to 92,051,051 nodes and 160,428,881,121 edges (Supplementary Materials), which presents a challenge to clustering software.
	
To address the limitation of disjoint clusters with IKC, we developed  ``Allowing Overlapping Clusters" (AOC), a scalable meta-method that takes the output of IKC and makes multiple community assignments from a list of candidate nodes. AOC can be used as an optional step in the IKC pipeline at the discretion of the user. We present results from AOC applied to the cores generated by the IKC method, and discuss the results and discovery made from them. 
	
While the overarching question that motivates our work is identifying and describing research communities, this article is focused on the more narrow question of extending the IKC method towards inclusively identifying the cores of core-periphery structured communities and towards more general use in community detection. We present results from testing this method on a network centered around the recent extracellular vesicle literature, a very rapidly growing field in biology \citep{van2022challenges}. 

\section{Materials and Methods}
	
\subsection{Methods} Motivated by the graph-theoretic concept of k-cores \citep{Giatsidis2011,malliaros2019}, we have previously constructed a clustering pipeline we refer to as  the Iterative K-core Clustering (IKC) pipeline in \cite{Wedell2022}, This scalable and tunable method takes, as input, two parameters $k$ and $p$ with $k > p \geq 1$, and computes a clustering of a given network $N$ into disjoint clusters where each cluster has a ``core'' component, and a ``periphery". This clustering is designed to satisfy several criteria: (1) the core of each cluster is connected,  has positive modularity ($m$-valid), and each node in the center  is adjacent to at least $k$ other nodes in the center ($k$-valid), and (ii) every node in the periphery of a cluster is adjacent to at least $p$ center nodes in the cluster ($p$-valid). Thus, membership of the core of a cluster requires a greater degree of connectivity to the other center nodes than membership of the periphery. 
	
The IKC pipeline has three basic steps, where the second and third steps are optional.  The first step (the iterative k-core extraction algorithm) produces disjoint $km$-valid clusters where each cluster has positive modularity and each node in each cluster is adjacent to at least $k$ other nodes in the cluster; these form the centers or cores of the communities. The optional second and third steps breaks these clusters into smaller clusters, and adds peripheries to the clusters respectively.  Note that the parameter $k$ is used to define the centers and the parameter $p$ is used to define the periphery. If the only objective is cores or centers of communities, then the pipeline can be run using only the first step (or optionally also with the second step if smaller communities are desired).
	
\emph{Allowing Overlapping Clusters (AOC)}. The AOC method, presented herein, builds on the first step of the IKC pipeline (k-core extraction). To run AOC, the user specifies two additional parameters:  the set of nodes that can be members of  additional clusters and the criterion for membership.  The two criteria for membership in the core of cluster $C$ we consider are: (i) to have at least $MCD(C)$ neighbors in the center of $C$, where $MCD(C)$ is the minimum core degree; the minimum number of center neighbors of any node within $C$ or (ii) to have at least $k$ neighbors in the core of $C$.  We note that $k$ (the parameter for condition (i)) has been used to construct the IKC clustering; hence, for every cluster $C$,  (ii) is a weaker condition than (i). We refer to the first as AOC\_m and the second as AOC\_k.
	
Thus, running   AOC on the IKC clustering produces a set of potentially overlapping clusters, each of which has positive modularity and has at least $k$ other nodes in the cluster. These clusters form the cores of communities.  This study is focused on core structure but the clustering process could be extended to the same optional second and third steps from the IKC pipeline, which would break up the large clusters and add peripheral nodes. 
	
AOC begins by parsing the input clustering file for kmp-validity and running the resulting kmp-valid clustering file through the candidate selection stage. The candidate selection stage either selects candidate nodes from the network based on a user-specified list of node ids, which can be based on node-network characteristics such as total degree, in-degree, and out-degree or some other basis for candidate selection such as publication venue or funding sources.
	
Once candidate nodes are chosen, AOC constructs overlapping clusters by adding all candidate nodes to all clusters that meet either of the two inclusion criterion, maintaining the k-core of the clustering or the minimum core degree of the given cluster. Another condition that a candidate node must satisfy when added to a cluster is that inclusion of candidate node to the given cluster keeps positive modularity within the cluster. The overlapping cluster construction stage of this method adds these candidate nodes as non-core members of clusters they are added while original members of the clusters are labelled as core members of the clusters they were originally a part of. This property allows the construction stage to run a single pass through all clusters for each candidate node without recursively iterating back through each cluster if they are updated from previous passes through this stage.
	
The resulting clustering generated from the overlapping clusters construction stage can now contains nodes in multiple clusterins, a property not found in the IKC method. 
	
\subsection{Data} 
\emph{Citation network} We previously generated a citation network \citep{Wedell2022} representing the exosome \citep{harding1983} and more generally the extracellular vesicle literature \citep{raposo2021} from the Dimensions database \citep{hook2018dimensions} in the Google cloud. For the present study, we curated this network to deplete it of both retracted articles and relatively high-referencing articles. Retractions were identified from a database kindly provided by Retraction Watch \citep{rw2022} and matched to nodes in the network using digital object identifiers (DOIs). Any article with 250 or more references was also removed. 

While the network in \cite{Wedell2022} consisted of 14,695,475 nodes and 99,663,372 edges, the network resultant from removing retracted and high-referencing articles comprised 13,989,436 nodes and 92,051,051 edges; we refer to this network as the Curated Exosome Network (CEN). Its largest connected component consists of 13,988,426 nodes and accounts for 99.99\% of the CEN.
	
\emph{Marker nodes}. To identify exosome-relevant publications and communities, we re-used a set of marker nodes described in  \citep{Wedell2022}. These 1,218 markers are the cited references combined from 12 different recent review articles on exosomes and extracellular vesicles. Of these, 1,021 are present in the CEN and  were used to identify clusters relevant to extracellular vesicles research.
	
\section{Results and Discussion}
	
As we explain in the preceding sections, AOC is a meta-method for overlapping communities that takes as input (i) a k-core based clustering such as IKC, (ii) a set of candidate nodes for consideration of membership in multiple communities, and (iii) a parameter $k$ or $m$ that defines the criterion for membership (Materials and Methods). We now examine the properties of non-disjoint clusterings produced using IKC and AOC in tandem. We analyze the effects of AOC on IKC clusters using either the nodes in non-singleton IKC clusters as candidates (the second input parameter) or nodes in singleton clusters. We also study the distribution of marker nodes in AOC enhanced clusters and finally, examine overlap across AOC clusters.

		\item multiple cluster assignments per node; non-singleton node redistribution experiments
		\item node property effects - degree, and Tier
		\item candidate node experiment- singleton high degree experiments
		\item marker node effects
		\item redraw graph based on node overlaps
		\item classify nodes reassigned to multiple clusters
		\item other?
\end{itemize}
	
\subsection{Experiment 1: Comparison to random networks} In an initial exploratory experiment, we clustered the curated exosome network (CEN) using IKC where $k \in {\{10,20,30,40, 50\}}$. The resultant distribution of cores is consistent with prior observations on IKC clustering \citep[Figure 3]{Wedell2022} with maximum coverage seen at the lowest value of $k$ used. At the value of $k$ with maximum coverage (IKC\_k10) in the CEN, 128 $km$-valid ($k >=10$ and modularity $> 0$) cores containing a total of 535,165 nodes (3.8\% of the CEN network) are discovered. These cores range in size from 14 to 214,877, with a median core size of 79, and minimum core degree (MCD) varying from 10 to 53 with median MCD of 16. Thus, the CEN is a 53-degenerate graph consisting of 13,989,436 vertices.
	
To examine random network effects that could contribute to observed results from IKC, we generated 10 replicates of a configuration null model where the edges of the input network were randomized while preserving the total number of nodes, the degree of each node,  and the publication year of each cited node in a citing-cited node pair. These shuffled networks were then clustered using IKC\_k10. In all 10 cases, only a single $km$-valid core with MCD of 15 was extracted, although the number of nodes in each of these cores varied (Table~\ref{tab:tab1}). The median size of this cluster across 10 replicates was 435,216. We did not run IKC at higher values for $k$ in the range that we used ($k \in {\{10,20,30,40, 50\}}$) on the shuffled networks since  the minimum core degree (MCD) of 15 for the single cluster would have been exceeded and no clusters would have resulted. We did not run AOC on the output from IKC.k10 since by definition AOC cannot add new members when the clustering has only one cluster. 

We also generated 100 replicates of an Erd\H{o}s-Renyi graph with the same number of nodes and edges as the CEN network and clustered them with IKC\_k10 (Supplementary Material). No $km$-valid clusters were generated from the Erd\H{o}s-Renyi graphs. We did not run AOC on the IKC output from  the Erd\H{o}s-Renyi graphs, since there were no clusters to use as input. 
	
The distinct differences in outcomes between the real world CEN network and the two random models we explored show that, the results seen in IKC clustering on a real world network are unlikely to be the result of random effects alone. \textcolor{red}{This sentence reads like a statement of personal conviction.

\subsection{Experiment 2: Effect of AOC on IKC clusters} 
As we assert (\emph{vide supra}), a limitation of disjoint clustering methods is that restricting membership to one community excludes assignment to other communities where a node may have both role and influence. Since clustering with IKC occurs iteratively with the most dense core being extracted first, nodes in an extracted core are not considered for membership in cores that are subsequently extracted.

Accordingly, we asked whether AOC could redistribute nodes from disjoint cores generated by IKC to other cores in the same clustering. 
In this experiment,  we set the algorithmic parameters for AOC as follows: (i) the input clustering was produced by IKC with the CEN network as input and $k \in \{10, 20, 30, 40, 50\}$; (ii) the set of candidate nodes was every node within the cores generated by IKC; and (iii) the criterion for membership was either (i) AOC\_m or AOC\_k (defined above).
	
By construction, the number of cores cannot change by running AOC  under any setting of its algorithmic parameters. However, core sizes can increase, with increases resulting from AOC\_k being at least as large as increases resulting from AOC\_m. Of interest, therefore, is how the algorithmic parameters, such as the value for $k$ and the specified subset of nodes, impact the increase in size, and how node properties, such as degree, influence the number of clusters they are added to.
	
Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} shows the distribution of cluster sizes generated by AOC relative to the core sizes from the IKC run at various values for \emph{k}. For both AOC\_m and AOC\_k a subset of the clusters increases in size (Table~\ref{tab:tab1} ). Approximately 74\% and 87\% of  128 cores increase in size with AOC\_m and AOC\_k treatment respectively when IKC with k=10 is used as the input clustering. AOC treatment of IKC clustering, therefore, results in an increase in cluster sizes that is is inversely related to the value of \emph{k} used in IKC and is more pronounced with AOC\_k than with AOC\_m.

IKC, the value $k$ used to construct the clustering, and the set of nodes to be distributed to additional clusters was all the nodes in the IKC clusters.  Points that lie on the diagonal indicate no change in cluster size after AOC treatment. A natural log scale is used for both axes.}

We then examined the distribution of clusters per candidate node after AOC treatment of clusterings generated by  IKC. For AOC\_k treatment of IKC\_k10 clusters, 54\% of nodes in non-singleton clusters were assigned to between 2 and 24 clusters in a progressively decreasing manner with roughly 26\% of nodes assigned to 2 clusters and a single node being assigned to 24 different clusters (Table~\ref{tab:tab2}).  The remaining 46\% of the nodes were assigned to a single cluster. AOC\_m, in comparison to AOC\_k, results in fewer multiple cluster assignments because of its more stringent membership criterion (Table~\ref{tab:tab2} and Figure~\ref{fig:fig2}).

To ask whether node degree is associated with the number of clusters assigned to, we examined clustered nodes in the CEN and compared their total in-graph degree to the number of clusters they were assigned, either in AOC\_m or AOC\_k treatment of IKC\_k10 clustering of the CEN (Figure~\ref{fig:fig3}). We partitioned the nodes into five groups based on their total in-network degree (in\_degree + out\_degree),  with group 1 containing the nodes with the smallest total degree (less than 100), group 2 with nodes of total degree between 100 and 999, group 3 with nodes of total degree between 1000 and 9,999, group 4 with nodes of total degree between 10,000 and 99,999, and group 5 the nodes with total degree at least 100,000.

Over, 98\% of these 535,165 nodes are in groups 1 and 2; 50.9\% in group 1, 47.6\% in group  2, 1.5\% in group 3,  0.03\% in group 4, and 0.0007\% in group 5. sAlthough group classification is based on total degree,  any publication in groups 2-5 with high total degree must have high in-degree(in-network citation count). Membership in group 3  reflects a large citation count (at least 750 in-graph citations), and membership in groups 4 or 5, the top 169 nodes by total degree, reflects ultra-large citation counts (at least 9,750 in-graph citations).    
	
We first compare clusterings produced by AOC\_m and AOC\_k (left subfigure), which shows that the number of clusters assignments per node is larger for AOC\_k than for AOC\_m. This is not unexpected since AOC\_m is a more stringent membership criterion. For both AOC\_m and AOC\_k, the number of clusters that any node is assigned to increases as we move from group 1 to group 5, showing that in general total degree is associated with the number of clusters that a node is assigned to. Hence, in-network citation count is associated with the number of clusters that a publication is a core member of.
	
However, the distributions for each group are overlapping, revealing potentially interesting differences between publications that are not explained just by citation count. The largest number of clusters any node is assigned to is 25 and the smallest number is 1. All the nodes assigned to 14 or more communities are in groups 4 or 5, and so have total degree at least 10,000. In addition, group 5 publications belong to a minimum of 14 clusters. In contrast, every other group has publications that belong to only 1 cluster. 

The largest number of communities for publications in groups 1 and 2 is  9,  group 3 publications appear in at most 13 communities, group 4 publications appear in up to 20 communities, 
and group 5 publications appear in up to 25 communities. 	Since only group 5 publications appear in more than 20 communities, we conclude that, under the conditions of our clustering,
an ultra-high in-graph citation count is  necessary  for assignment to a large number of communities.  
	
While there appears to be an association between the degree of a node and the likelihood of it being assigned to multiple clusters, there are instances of nodes of relatively low degree being assigned to multiple clusters and nodes of relatively high degree being assigned to one or two clusters. Examining small numbers of such cases did not reveal any obvious qualities that would explain this pattern. This may underscore the case for mixed methods approaches to interpret publication influence and roles within communities. This also shows that high total degree is not sufficient for membership in many communities. 
	
Another perspective that provides additional insight into publications is their ``tier" within their communities. In \cite{Chandrasekharan2021}, we  proposed a tier classification for nodes in a cluster, in which Tier 1 refers to the nodes in the top 10th percentile with respect to intra-cluster citations. Thus, when measuring in-degree within the cluster, a Tier 1 node is in the top 10 percent compared to all other nodes in its cluster. 

We observe that nodes assigned to multiple clusters are more likely to have Tier 1 status (Figure~\ref{fig:fig3}, right subfigure). The Tier 1 count also increases for AOC\_k compared to AOC\_m. The greater Tier I count for AOC\_k is likely a combination of larger clusters and the in-degree of nodes within them.

For groups 1--4, there are some publications that are Tier 1 in all communities they belong to, some that are never in Tier 1, but the majority are in between. 
However, while the four publications in group 5 are Tier 1 for at least 7 communities, only one is in Tier 1 for more than 10 communities. 
Interestingly, there are four publications in Group 4 that are in Tier 1 for at least 10 communities, two that are Tier 1 in more than 10 communities, and one of these is Tier 1 in 15 communities.
	
These trends show that while total degree is correlated with the number of clusters a publication belongs to and how many clusters it is Tier 1 for,
these values are not determined just by total degree. Thus, the cluster membership and Tier status within their communities provides complementary insights into  the publications that goes beyond its citation count.

\subsection{Experiment 3: High Degree Singleton Nodes} 
	
IKC clustering of the CEN results in 3.8\% coverage. A number of nodes of high degree are assigned to singleton clusters (essentially left unclustered). In the case of the CEN clustered by IKC\_k10, 15,039 nodes in the top 1\% (by degree) of nodes in the network are assigned to singleton clusters. We examine here whether this population is reduced after AOC treatment of IKC clusters. With AOC\_m using the 15,039 nodes as candidates no additional assignments are made, i.e., the output of AOC\_m is indistinguishable from IKC\_k10. With AOC\_k, however, 7,459 of 15,039 (49.6 \%) of the singleton nodes are assigned to IKC\_k10 clusters. The extent to which these 7,459 nodes are assigned to multiple clusters is also less, with all nodes assigned to at most 5 clusters, most nodes assigned to only one cluster, and only one node assigned to 5 clusters (Figure~\ref{fig:singleton}). In terms of cluster size increases, this result is mild in effect. 71\% of the 128 clusters in this AOC\_k treatment do not increase in size. In comparison, 4\% and 87\% of the 128 clusters increase in size with AOC\_m and AOC\_k treatment of 128 IKC clusters with non-singleton nodes as input.

These 15,039  nodes were used as candidate nodes for AOC\_m and AOC\_k treatment of IKC\_k10 clusters. After AOC\_m treatment, none of these 15,039 nodes were incorporated into any of the 128 clusters resulting from  IKC\_k10. After the more permissive AOC\_k protocol, 7,459 (49.6\%) were incorporated into one or more of the 128 IKC\_k10 clusters. The count of clusters is plotted against percent increase in cluster size for all 128 clusters. The maximum increase in cluster size was 8\%. The majority of the clusters (71\%) did not change in size. After AOC\_k treatment, 540,883 nodes (99\%) of the nodes were assigned to one cluster, 1504 to 2 clusters, 210 to 3 clusters, and 26 to 4 clusters. One node was assigned to 5 clusters.}

\section{Conclusions} We are positioned between method development and exploratory discovery. One objective is to construct a modular community finding pipeline that is relatively subject-independent. A second objective is to understand community structure in the extracellular vesicle literature. In combining the two, we have sought to include human experience and intent \citep{vonluxburg2012clustering} through controlling the input data and designing contextual evaluation criteria.
